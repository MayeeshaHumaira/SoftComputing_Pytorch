4th year 2nd semester Lab Soft Computing using Pytorch

This Repository consist of 5 projects using WebGL and GLSL. These 5 projects are:
* Bengali digit recognition using Logistic regression
* Gender detection from Bengali digits using Logistic regression
* Bengali digit recognition using Neural Network
* Gender detection from Bengali digits using Neural Network
* Pulmonary Disease (Covid and Pneumonia) Classification based on Lung Opacity using Neural Network

A detailed description of the project Pulmonary Disease (Covid and Pneumonia) Classification based on Lung Opacity using Neural Network is given 
<a href="Pulmonary Disease (Covid and Pneumonia) Classification based on Lung Opacity using Neural Network Report.pdf">Here</a>. 
Other descriptions are provided in the respective codes.
